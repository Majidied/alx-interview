### Problem Statement
The typical problem statement for generating Pascal's Triangle might be as follows:
"Write a function that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle of `n` rows. The function should take an integer `n` as input and generate the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle."

### Example
For example, if `n = 5`, the expected output would be:
```
[
 [1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```
