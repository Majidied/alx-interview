## Introduction
`0x03-log_parsing` is a Python-based utility designed to parse and analyze logs from various sources. This tool helps in extracting meaningful information from log files, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot applications.

## Objectives
The main objectives of `0x03-log_parsing` are:
- To provide a simple and efficient way to parse log files.
- To extract specific information based on predefined patterns.
- To support multiple log formats.
- To generate reports from the parsed log data.

## Prerequisites
Before using `0x03-log_parsing`, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x03-log_parsing.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh

    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Place the log files you want to parse in the `logs` directory.
2. Run the log parsing script:
    ```sh
    python parse_logs.py
    ```
3. The parsed data will be saved in the `output` directory as a report.

### Command Line Options
The `parse_logs.py` script supports the following command-line options:
- `-i` or `--input`: Specify the input log file or directory containing log files.
- `-o` or `--output`: Specify the output directory for the parsed data.
- `-p` or `--pattern`: Define the pattern to search for in the log files.

Example:
```sh
python parse_logs.py -i logs/access.log -o output/ -p "ERROR"
```

## Example
Here is an example of how to use the `0x03-log_parsing` tool:

1. Place your log file (e.g., `access.log`) in the `logs` directory.
2. Run the script with the desired options:
    ```sh
    python parse_logs.py -i logs/access.log -o output/ -p "ERROR"
    ```
3. Check the `output` directory for the generated report.
