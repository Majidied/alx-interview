# 0-starwars_characters.js

## Overview

`0-starwars_characters.js` is a JavaScript script designed to interact with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters. It utilizes Node.js and Axios for making HTTP requests to SWAPI endpoints and handling JSON responses.
